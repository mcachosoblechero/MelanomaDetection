# SpringBoard_Capstone

0. Initial Repositories Considered
As my area of expertise lies in Healthcare and Wearable devices, I would like my capstone project to align with this career vision. However, the main limitation for healthcare applications is the availability of publicly available clinical data.

Exploring Kaggle challenges, I found few datasets that might align with my vision for this project.
- Melanoma Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview
- Chest radiographs for COVID Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection/overview
- Chest X-Ray Images for Pneumonia Detection: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Based on the quality and the availability of data, as well as the potential of the dataset, I selected the <b>Melanoma Detection dataset</b>
